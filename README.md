# DeepViscosity
DeepViscosity is an ensemble deep learning ANN model developed to predict high-concentration monoclonal antibody viscosity classes (Low <= 20 cP, High > 20 cP). The model utilized 30 spatial properties (descriptors) obtained from DeepSP surrogate model as features for training. It was trained based on 229 mAbs.

# How to use DeepViscosity to Predict Low or High Class Viscosity

## Option 1 - Google colab notebook
- Prepare your input file according to the format DeepViscosity_input.csv
- Run the notebook file DeepViscosity_predictor.ipynb
- DeepViscosity Classes (as well as the DeepSP spatial properties) for sequences inputed, will be populated and saved to a csv file - DeepViscosity_classes.csv.

## Option 2 - Linux environment 
- create an environment and install necessary package
	- conda create -n deepViscosity python=3.9.13
	- source activate deepViscosity
	- conda install -c bioconda anarci
	- pip install keras==2.11.0 tensorflow-cpu==2.11.0 scikit-learn==1.0.2 pandas numpy==1.26.4 joblib dill

- Prepare your input file according to the format DeepViscosity_input.csv
- Run the python file `deepviscosity_predictor.py` using the following command:
  ```bash
  python deepviscosity_predictor.py your_input_file.csv
  ```
  Replace `your_input_file.csv` with the actual name of your input file.
- DeepViscosity Classes (as well as the DeepSP spatial properties) for sequences inputed, will be obtained and saved to a csv file - DeepViscosity_classes.csv.

**Note:** Ensure that you have activated the `deepViscosity` conda environment before running the script. If you haven't created the environment and installed the dependencies, please refer to the installation instructions above.
